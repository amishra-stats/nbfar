Description: The R package nbfar implements Negative Binomial factor regression models that allow the estimation of structured (sparse) associations between a feature matrix X and overdispersed count data Y. The package has been developed with microbiome count data Y in mind and can be used, e.g., to associate host or environmental covariates with microbial abundances. Currently, two models are available: a) Negative Binomial reduced rank regression (NB-RRR), b) Negative Binomial co-sparse factor regression (NB-FAR).
