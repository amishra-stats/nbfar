  Abstract                 = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

  Abstract                 = {In the classical linear regression model with p dependent variables constituting the vector Y and q independent variables constituting the vector X the rank k of the regression matrix B of Y on X may be less than p and q. In that case the estimator of B, called the "reduced rank regression estimator," is composed of the k canonical variables corresponding to the k largest canonical correlations (Anderson, 1951). The asymptotic distribution of this estimator has been found when the rank is correctly specified and X and the residual Y - BX are independent with finite variances (Anderson, 1999b). The reduced rank regression estimator is more efficient than the least squares estimator, markedly so if k is small. This paper considers the properties of the estimator when the rank is not correctly specified. When the specified rank of B is less than the true rank, biases occur; when the specified rank is greater, variances of estimators and predictors are unnecessarily large. These results are related to tests concerning the rank.},

  Abstract                 = {{this paper, we introduce nonlinear regularized wavelet estimators for estimating nonparametric regression functions when sampling points are not uniformly spaced. The approach can apply readily to many other statistical contexts. Various new penalty functions are proposed . The hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding estimators of Donoho and Johnstone are speci\# c members of nonlinear regularized wavelet estimators. They correspond to the lower and upper envelopes of a class of the penalized least squares estimators. Necessary conditions for penalty functions are given for regularized estimators to possess thresholding properties. Oracle inequalities and universal thresholding parameters are obtained for a large class of penalty functions. The sampling properties of nonlinear regularized wavelet estimators are established and are shown to be adaptively minimax. To ef\# ciently solve penalized least squares problems, nonlinear regularized Sobolev interpolators (NRS I) are proposed as initial estimators, which are shown to have good sampling properties. The NRS I is further ameliorated by regularized one-step estimators, which are the one-step estimators of the penalized least squares problems using the NRS I as initial estimators. The graduated nonconvexity algorithm is also introduced to handle penalized least squares problems}},

  Abstract                 = {{Performance bounds for criteria for model selection are developed using recent theory for sieves. The model selection criteria are based on an empirical loss or contrast function with an added penalty term motivated by empirical process theory and roughly proportional to the number of parameters needed to describe the model divided by the number of observations. Most of our examples involve density or regression estimation settings and we focus on the problem of estimating the unknown density or regression function. We show that the quadratic risk of the minimum penalized empirical contrast estimator is bounded by an index of the accuracy of the sieve. This accuracy index quantifies the trade-off among the candidate models between the approximation error and parameter dimension relative to sample size. If we choose a list of models which exhibit good approximation properties with respect to different classes of smoothness, the estimator can be simultaneously minimax rate optimal in each of those classes. This is what is usually called adaptation . The type of classes of smoothness in which one gets adaptation depends heavily on the list of models. If too many models are involved in order to get accurate approximation of many wide classes of functions simultaneously, it may happen that the estimator is only approximately adaptive (typically up to a slowly varying function of the sample size). We shall provide various illustrations of our method such as penalized maximum likelihood, projection or least squares estimation. The models will involve commonly used finite dimensional expansions such as piecewise polynomials with fixed or variable knots, trigonometric polynomials, wavelets, neural nets and related nonlinear expansions defined by superposition of ridge functions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.}},

Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we analyzed mRNA expression levels corresponding to 12,600 transcript sequences in 186 lung tumor samples, including 139 adenocarcinomas resected from the lung. Hierarchical and probabilistic clustering of expression data defined distinct subclasses of lung adenocarcinoma. Among these were tumors with high relative expression of neuroendocrine genes and of type II pneumocyte genes, respectively. Retrospective analysis revealed a less favorable outcome for the adenocarcinomas with neuroendocrine gene expression. The diagnostic potential of expression profiling is emphasized by its ability to discriminate primary lung adenocarcinomas from metastases of extra-pulmonary origin. These results suggest that integration of expression profile data with clinical parameters could aid in diagnosis of lung cancer patients.},

The results are uniform over families of covariance matrices which satisfy a fairly natural notion of sparsity. We discuss an intuitive resampling scheme for threshold selection and prove a general cross-validation result that justifies this approach.

  Abstract                 = {A new method, called the nonnegative (nn) garrote, is proposed for doing subset regression. It both shrinks and zeroes coefficients. In tests on real and simulated data, it produces lower prediction error than ordinary subset selection. It is also compared to ridge regression. If the regression equations generated by a procedure do not change drastically with small changes in the data, the procedure is called stable. Subset selection is unstable, ridge is very stable, and the nn-garrote is intermediate. Simulation results illustrate the effects of instability on prediction error.},

  Abstract                 = {{Many studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to continuous variation in heritable traits of interest. However, general principles regarding the distribution of QTL numbers, effect sizes, and combined effects of multiple QTLs remain to be elucidated. Here, we characterize complex genetics underlying inheritance of thousands of transcript levels in a cross between two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most detected QTLs have weak effects, with a median variance explained of 27\% for highly heritable transcripts. Despite the high statistical power of the study, no QTLs were detected for 40\% of highly heritable transcripts, indicating extensive genetic complexity. Modeling of QTL detection showed that only 3\% of highly heritable transcripts are consistent with single-locus inheritance, 17ï¿½C18\% are consistent with control by one or two loci, and half require more than five loci under additive models. Strikingly, analysis of parent and progeny trait distributions showed that a majority of transcripts exhibit transgressive segregation. Sixteen percent of highly heritable transcripts exhibit evidence of interacting loci. Our results will aid design of future QTL mapping studies and may shed light on the evolution of quantitative traits.}},

The choice from among a large class of possible generalizations is guided by Bayesian considerations; the result is implicitly in the work of Lindley and Smith although not actually derived there. The proposed rule, in a variety of equivalent forms is discussed and the choice of its ridge matrix considered. As well, adaptive multivariate ridge rules and closely related empirical Bayes procedures are presented, these being for the most part formal extensions of certain univariate rules. Included is the Efron-Morris multivariate version of the James-Stein estimator. By means of an appropriate generalization of a result of Morris (see Thisted) the mean square error of these adaptive and empirical Bayes rules are compared.},

  Abstract                 = {There has recently been renewed research interest in the development of tests of the rank of a matrix. This article evaluates the performance of some asymptotic tests of rank determination in reduced rank regression models together with bootstrapped versions through simulation experiments. The bootstrapped procedures significantly improve on the performance of the corresponding asymptotic tests. The article also presents a Monte Carlo exercise comparing the forecasting performance of reduced rank and unrestricted vector autoregressive (VAR) models in which the former appear superior. The tests of rank considered here are then applied to construct reduced rank VAR models for leading indicators of U.K. economic activity. These more parsimonious multivariate representations display an improvement in forecasting performance over that of unrestricted VAR models.},

  Abstract                 = {
Jiang and Tanner (2008) consider a method of classification using the Gibbs posterior which is directly constructed from the empirical classification errors. They propose an algorithm to sample from the Gibbs posterior which utilizes a smoothed approximation of the empirical classification error, via a Gibbs sampler with augmented latent variables. In this paper, we note some drawbacks of this algorithm and propose an alternative method for sampling from the Gibbs posterior, based on the Metropolis algorithm. The numerical performance of the algorithms is examined and compared via simulated data. We find that the Metropolis algorithm produces good classification results at an improved speed of computation.},

In each of these examples, the mean square error of these rules is less than half that of the sample mean.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A new criterion is proposed for the evaluation of variable selection procedures in multiple regression. This criterion, which we call the risk inflation, is based on an adjustment to the risk. Essentially, the risk inflation is the maximum increase in risk due to selecting rather than knowing the "correct" predictors. A new variable selection procedure is obtained which, in the case of orthogonal predictors, substantially improves on AIC, Cp and BIC and is close to optimal. In contrast to AIC, Cp and BIC which use dimensionality penalties of 2, 2 and log n, respectively, this new procedure uses a penalty 2 log p, where p is the number of available predictors. For the case of nonorthogonal predictors, bounds for the optimal penalty are obtained.}},

  Abstract                 = {Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are widely used in the fitting of generalized linear models (GLMs). Such model fitting is somewhat of an art form, requiring suitable trickery and tuning to obtain results in which one can have confidence. A wide range of practical issues arise. The focus here is on parameter identifiability and posterior propriety. In particular, we clarify that nonidentifiability arises for usual GLMs and discuss its implications for simulation-based model fitting. Because often some part of the prior specification is vague, we consider whether the resulting posterior is proper, providing rather general and easily checked results for GLMs. We also show that if a Gibbs sampler is run with an improper posterior, then it may be possible to use the output to obtain meaningful inference for certain model unknowns.},

  Abstract                 = {In multiple regression problems when covariates can be naturally grouped, it is important to carry out feature selection at the group and within-group individual variable levels simultaneously. The existing methods, including the lasso and group lasso, are designed for either variable selection or group selection, but not for both. We propose a group bridge approach that is capable of simultaneous selection at both the group and within-group individual variable levels. The proposed approach is a penalized regularization method that uses a specially designed group bridge penalty. It has the oracle group selection property, in that it can correctly select important groups with probability converging to one. In contrast, the group lasso and group least angle regression methods in general do not possess such an oracle property in group selection. Simulation studies indicate that the group bridge has superior performance in group and individual variable selection relative to several existing methods. 10.1093/biomet/asp020},

Under the assumption of joint normality of the two sets of variates, we give the asymptotic (large-sample) distributions of the various estimated reduced-rank regression coefficient matrices that are of interest. Approximate confidence bounds on the elements of these matrices are then suggested using either the appropriate asymptotic expressions or the jackknife technique.},

Based on a differential geometric approach, we derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom for this estimation method, under a smoothness assumption on the boundary of the closed convex set. The result presented in this paper is applicable to estimation with a wide class of constraints. As an application, we obtain a Cp type criterion and AIC for selecting tuning parameters.},

These estimators include the Lasso as a special case when gamma = 1. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the limiting distributions can have positive probability mass at 0 when the true value of the parameter is 0.

  Abstract                 = {Sparse singular value decomposition (SSVD) is proposed as a new exploratory analysis tool for biclustering or identifying interpretable row2013column associations within high-dimensional data matrices. SSVD seeks a low-rank, checkerboard structured matrix approximation to data matrices. The desired checkerboard structure is achieved by forcing both the left- and right-singular vectors to be sparse, that is, having many zero entries. By interpreting singular vectors as regression coefficient vectors for certain linear regressions, sparsity-inducing regularization penalties are imposed to the least squares regression to produce sparse singular vectors. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed for computing the sparse singular vectors, along with some discussion of penalty parameter selection. A lung cancer microarray dataset and a food nutrition dataset are used to illustrate SSVD as a biclustering method. SSVD is also compared with some existing biclustering methods using simulated datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {{A popular data-driven method for choosing the bandwidth in standard kernel regression is cross-validation. Even when there are outliers in the data, robust kernel regression can be used to estimate the unknown regression curve [Robust and Nonlinear Time Series Analysis. Lecture Notes in Statist. (1984) 26 163-184]. However, under these circumstances standard cross-validation is no longer a satisfactory bandwidth selector because it is unduly influenced by extreme prediction errors caused by the existence of these outliers. A more robust method proposed here is a cross-validation method that discounts the extreme prediction errors. In large samples the robust method chooses consistent bandwidths, and the consistency of the method is practically independent of the form in which extreme prediction errors are discounted. Additionally, evaluation of the method's finite sample behavior in a simulation demonstrates that the proposed method performs favorably. This method can also be applied to other problems, for example, model selection, that require cross-validation.}},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT. In cancer diagnosis studies, high-throughput gene profiling has been extensively conducted, searching for genes whose expressions may serve as markers. Data generated from such studies have the 'large d, small n' feature, with the number of genes profiled much larger than the sample size. Penalization has been extensively adopted for simultaneous estimation and marker selection. Because of small sample sizes, markers identified from the analysis of single data sets can be unsatisfactory. A cost-effective remedy is to conduct integrative analysis of multiple heterogeneous data sets. In this article, we investigate composite penalization methods for estimation and marker selection in integrative analysis. The proposed methods use the minimax concave penalty (MCP) as the outer penalty. Under the homogeneity model, the ridge penalty is adopted as the inner penalty. Under the heterogeneity model, the Lasso penalty and MCP are adopted as the inner penalty. Effective computational algorithms based on coordinate descent are developed. Numerical studies, including simulation and analysis of practical cancer data sets, show satisfactory performance of the proposed methods.}},

  Abstract                 = { We provide a novel and completely different approach to dimension-reduction problems from the existing literature. We cast the dimension-reduction problem in a semiparametric estimation framework and derive estimating equations. Viewing this problem from the new angle allows us to derive a rich class of estimators, and obtain the classical dimension reduction techniques as special cases in this class. The semiparametric approach also reveals that in the inverse regression context while keeping the estimation structure intact, the common assumption of linearity and/or constant variance on the covariates can be removed at the cost of performing additional nonparametric regression. The semiparametric estimators without these common assumptions are illustrated through simulation studies and a real data example. This article has online supplementary material.}

Two analytic methods of specifying k are proposed and evaluated in terms of mean square error by Monte Carlo simulations. With three explanatory variables and ?determined by the largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix, least squares is dominated by these estimators in all cases investigated; however, mixed results are obtained with ?determined by the smallest eigenvalue. These estimators compare favorably with other ridge-type estimators evaluated elsewhere for two explanatory variables.},

  Abstract                 = {{Summary.\&\#8194; The group lasso is an extension of the lasso to do variable selection on (predefined) groups of variables in linear regression models. The estimates have the attractive property of being invariant under groupwise orthogonal reparameterizations. We extend the group lasso to logistic regression models and present an efficient algorithm, that is especially suitable for high dimensional problems, which can also be applied to generalized linear models to solve the corresponding convex optimization problem. The group lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sample size but with sparse true underlying structure. We further use a two-stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the group lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, owing to the two-stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical. The methods are used on simulated and real data sets about splice site detection in DNA sequences.}},

The LASSO estimator typically has one or more zero elements and thus shares characteristics of both shrinkage estimation and variable selection. In this article we treat the LASSO as a convex programming problem and derive its dual. Consideration of the primal and dual problems together leads to important new insights into the characteristics of the LASSO estimator and to an improved method for estimating its covariance matrix. Using these results we also develop an efficient algorithm for computing LASSO estimates which is usable even in cases where the number of regressors exceeds the number of observations. An S-Plus library based on this algorithm is available from StatLib.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The Lasso estimate for linear regression parameters can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior mode estimate when the regression parameters have independent Laplace (i.e., double-exponential) priors. Gibbs sampling from this posterior is possible using an expanded hierarchy with conjugate normal priors for the regression parameters and independent exponential priors on their variances. A connection with the inverse-Gaussian distribution provides tractable full conditional distributions. The Bayesian Lasso provides interval estimates (Bayesian credible intervals) that can guide variable selection. Moreover, the structure of the hierarchical model provides both Bayesian and likelihood methods for selecting the Lasso parameter. Slight modifications lead to Bayesian versions of other Lasso-related estimation methods, including bridge regression and a robust variant.}},

An unbiased estimate of risk is obtained for an arbitrary estimate, and certain special classes of estimates are then discussed. The results are applied to smoothing by use of moving averages and to trimmed analogs of the James-Stein estimate. A suggestion is made for calculating approximate confidence sets for the mean vector centered at an arbitrary estimate.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary. The lasso penalizes a least squares regression by the sum of the absolute values (L1-norm) of the coefficients. The form of this penalty encourages sparse solutions (with many coefficients equal to 0). We propose the 'fused lasso', a generalization that is designed for problems with features that can be ordered in some meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes the L1-norm of both the coefficients and their successive differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients and also sparsity of their differences2014i.e. local constancy of the coefficient profile. The fused lasso is especially useful when the number of features p is much greater than N, the sample size. The technique is also extended to the 'hinge' loss function that underlies the support vector classifier. We illustrate the methods on examples from protein mass spectroscopy and gene expression data.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a penalized matrix decomposition (PMD), a new framework for computing a rank-K approximation for a matrix. We approximate the matrix X as circumflexX = sigma(k=1)(K) d(k)u(k)v(k)(T), where d(k), u(k), and v(k) minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X - circumflexX, subject to penalties on u(k) and v(k). This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L(1)-penalties on u(k) and v(k), which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the PMD is applied using an L(1)-penalty on v(k) but not on u(k), a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the "SCoTLASS" proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the SCoTLASS method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the PMD is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply this penalized CCA method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and DNA copy number measurements on the same set of samples.},

  Abstract                 = { We introduce a general formulation for dimension reduction and coefficient estimation in the multivariate linear model. We argue that many of the existing methods that are commonly used in practice can be formulated in this framework and have various restrictions. We continue to propose a new method that is more flexible and more generally applicable. The method proposed can be formulated as a novel penalized least squares estimate. The penalty that we employ is the coefficient matrix's Ky Fan norm. Such a penalty encourages the sparsity among singular values and at the same time gives shrinkage coefficient estimates and thus conducts dimension reduction and coefficient estimation simultaneously in the multivariate linear model. We also propose a generalized cross-validation type of criterion for the selection of the tuning parameter in the penalized least squares. Simulations and an application in financial econometrics demonstrate competitive performance of the new method. An extension to the non-parametric factor model is also discussed.

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p226Bn case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

However, PCA su\#ers from the fact that each principal component is a linear combination of all the original variables, thus it is often di\#cult to interpret the results. We introduce a new method called sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) using the lasso (elastic net) to produce modified principal components with sparse loadings. We show that PCA can be formulated as a regression-type optimization problem, then sparse loadings are obtained by imposing the lasso (elastic net) constraint on the regression coe\#cients. E\#cient algorithms are proposed to realize SPCA for both regular multivariate data and gene expression arrays. We also give a new formula to compute the total variance of modified principal components. As illustrations, SPCA is applied to real and simulated data, and the results are encouraging.}},
